## The Radiated Book - ed. Femke Snelting

The Radiated Book is a collection of essays with [Paul Otlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet), the father of documentation science, and Otlet's Mundameum (his extensive archive) as center their centeral elements of the essays.

> In 1993, the remains of Otlet’s extensive collection of documents were moved from Brussels to The Mundaneum Archive Center in Mons. Located in a former mining region in the south of Belgium, Mons is also right next to Google’s largest datacenter in Europe. Due to the re-branding of Otlet as a ‘founding father of the Internet’, and ‘visionary inventor of Google on paper’, his oeuvre received international attention. Simultaneously, local politicians have been ceasing the moment, making The Mundaneum a central node in their rhetorical promise of turning the industrial heartland into a home for The Internet Age. Google — grateful for discovering their posthumous francophone roots — signed a collaboration contract with The Mundaneum in 2013. The archive center outsourced its digital archives to the search giant, allowing them to publish hundreds of documents on the website of The Google Cultural Institute.

> Bringing these ever expanding entanglements gradually to light, a band of artists, archivists and activists formed. Wanting to make a difference from how geographically situated histories are meshed into generic slogans, concerned by faltering local governments pushing cultural infrastructures into the hands of global corporations and perplexed by the apparently still undigested dreams of universal knowledge, we decided to appropriate Mondothèque as a frame of reference. Imagined by Paul Otlet in 1934, La Mondothèque was to be a ’thinking machine’: archive, link generator, desk, catalog and broadcast station at the same time. The dreamed capacity of Mondothèque to combine scales, perspectives and media started to function as a diffraction device, as a platform to envision our modest but persistent interventions together.

Raw content: http://wiki.hackersanddesigners.nl/mediawiki/index.php/Book_sprint_2015
    
About Bugs Bots & Bytes is a self-published reader, compiled by Amsterdam-based collective Hackers & Designers. The content of the reader has been accumulated collectively during and after the H&D Summer Academy 2015 – About Bugs Bots and Bytes.  

The web- and print documentation is a collective investigation into cross-media publishing. Inspired by DIY culture and publications such as the [Whole Earth Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog), the reader has been prepped as a collection of How To-manuals, articles and adverts. Further information and digital media content can be found on hackersanddesigners.nl, wiki.hackersanddesigners.nl and github.com/hackersanddesigners/HDSA2015


The Hackers & Designers Summer Academy 2015 was funded by
Stimulieringsfonds and kindly supported by WAAG Society
and Lava Lab.

This publication uses materials produced during the H&D Summer Academy 2015 and is compiled using Wikimedia as a co-publishing platform.
