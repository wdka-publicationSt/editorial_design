##Jeremy Bailey

Jeremy Bailey is a Toronto-based Famous New Media Artist whose work explores custom software in a performative context.

“Since the early noughties Bailey has ploughed a compelling, and often hilarious, road through the various developments of digital communications technologies. Ostensibly a satire on, and parody of, the practices and language of “new media,” the jocose surface of Bailey’s work hides an incisive exploration of the critical intersection between video, computing, performance, and the body. The unique terrain of Bailey’s work sits between a collision of the rarefied and the populist.“ (Rhizome)

##Rosa Menkman

Rosa Menkman is a Dutch artist and theorist who likes to focus on visual artifacts created by accidents in both analogue and digital media. The visuals she makes are the result of glitches, compressions, feedback and other forms of noise. Although many people perceive these accidents as negative experiences, Rosa emphasizes their positive consequences. She believes these artifacts facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure world of media resolutions.
By combining both her practical as well as her academic background, she intends to merge her practice into a grand theory artifacts (a study of glitch ecologies).

##Metahaven

Metahaven is a studio for design and research based in Amsterdam. Since its launch in 2007, the team — founded by [[Dani%C3%ABl_van_der_Velden|Daniel Van der Velden]] and Vinca Kruk — has pursued collaborations with organizations that traditionally don’t seek out graphic design as a platform or medium. Examples include the whistleblower platform WikiLeaks, the Icelandic Modern 
Media Institute (IMMI), and the diplomatic advisory group Independent Diplomat.
An interdisciplinary group of writers, editors, critics, and curators, the collective has been able to expand upon the foundation of designer as form-maker and break free from the traditional confines of the studio. Its avant-garde aesthetics and intellectual approaches have lead to exhibitions at the Walker Art Center, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Metahaven has also written extensively about the internet as a political and creative space.

##Dr. Vadim Zaytsev

Dr. Vadim Zaytsev, also known in the social media as @grammarware, is a lecturer and a coordinator of the Software Engineering Master of Science programme at the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA) in Amsterdam. He has acquired PhD in 2010 at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the field of software language engineering, in which his current main research interests lie. He has done such research at Universität Koblenz-Landau in Germany (2008–2010) and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in the Netherlands (2010–2013).
