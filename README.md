## About Bugs Bots & Bytes - Hackers & Designers. 
Raw content: http://wiki.hackersanddesigners.nl/mediawiki/index.php/Book_sprint_2015
    
About Bugs Bots & Bytes is a self-published reader, compiled by Amsterdam-based collective Hackers & Designers. The content of the reader has been accumulated collectively during and after the H&D Summer Academy 2015 – About Bugs Bots and Bytes.  

The web- and print documentation is a collective investigation into cross-media publishing. Inspired by DIY culture and publications such as The Whole Earth Catalog, the reader has been prepped as a collection of How To-manuals, articles and adverts. Further information and digital media content can be found on hackersanddesigners.nl, wiki.hackersanddesigners.nl and github.com/hackersanddesigners/HDSA2015


The Hackers & Designers Summer Academy 2015 was funded by
Stimulieringsfonds and kindly supported by WAAG Society
and Lava Lab.

This publication uses materials produced during the H&D Summer Academy 2015 and is compiled using Wikimedia as a co-publishing platform.
