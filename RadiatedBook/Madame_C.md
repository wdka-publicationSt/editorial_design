## [Madame C.01](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Wilhelmina_Coops "Wilhelmina Coops")

When I arrived in Brussels that autumn, I was still very young. I
thought that as an au-pair I would be helping out in the house, but
instead I ended up working with the professor on finishing his book. At
the time I arrived, the writing was done but his handwriting was so hard
to decipher that the printer had a difficult time working with the
manuscript. It became my job to correct the typeset proofs but often
there were words that neither the printer nor I could decipher, so we
had to ask. But the professor often had no time for us. So I did my best
to make the text as comprehensible as possible.

On the title page of the final proofs from the printer, the professor
wrote to me:

*After five months of work behind the same table, here it is. Now it is
your turn to love the book, the pre-book and the spoken word, and to
develop a good sense of documentation, of institution, and of
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum").*^[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)^

## [Madame C.02](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Madame_Canonne "Madame Canonne")

She serves us coffee from a ceramic coffee pot and also a cake bought at
the bakery next door. *It's all written in the files* she reminds us
repeatedly, and tells us about one day in the sixties, when her husband
returned home, telling her excitedly that he discovered the
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum")
at Chaussée de Louvain in Brussels. Ever since, he would return to the
same building, making friends with the friends of the Palais Mondial,
those dedicated caretakers of the immense paper heritage.

*I haven't been there so often myself*, she says. *But I do remember
there were cats, to keep the mice away from the paper. And my husband
loved cats. So in the eighties, when he was finally in a position to
save the archives, the cats had to be taken care of too. And the cats
were written into the inventory.*

We finish our coffee and she takes us behind a curtain that separates
the salon from a small office. She shows us four green binders that
contain the meticulously filed papers of her late husband pertaining to
the
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum").
In the third is the Donation act, dated April 4 1985, that describes the
transfer of the archives from the Friends of the Palais Mondial to the
Center for public reading of the French community.

In the document, the cats are nowhere to be
found.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)^

## [Madame C.O3](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Cato_van_Nederhasselt "Cato van Nederhasselt")

In a margarine box, between thousands of notes, tickets, postcards,
letters, all folded to the size of an index card, we find this:

*Paul, leave me the key to ~~my~~the house, I forgot mine. Put it on
your desk, in the small index card box.*^[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)^
