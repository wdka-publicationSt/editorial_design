#Bottle Rocket#

Made during the *Domestic Drone Defense* workshop by Linder Basil Lukas, Scott van Haastrecht, and Flaminia Fortunato.

As the air is pumped through the water, the pressure inside the bottle builds up until the force of the air pushing on the water is enough to push the cork out of the end of the bottle. The water rushes out of the bottle in one direction whilst the bottle pushes back in the other. This results in the bottle shooting upwards. By attaching a net to the bottle rocket and aiming the projectile to the drone, the hostile device will be taken down as the net obstructs the propellors.
