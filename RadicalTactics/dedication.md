# Dedication

*This book is dedicated to the memory of Aaron Swartz.*



*Sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by
greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.*

Aaron Swartz (2008)



*Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes
hurtling down the highway.*

Andrew S. Tanenbaum (1989)
