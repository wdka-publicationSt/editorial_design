This timeline starts in Brussels and is an attempt to situate some of
the events in the life, death and revival of the
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum")
in relation to both local and international events. By connecting
several geographic locations at different scales, this small research
provokes [cqrrelations](http://www.cqrrelations.constantvzw.org) in time
and space that could help formulate questions about the ways local
events repeatedly mirror and recompose global situations. Hopefully, it
can also help to see which contextual elements in the first iteration of
the
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum")
were different from the current situation of our information economy.

The ambitious project of the
[Mundaneum](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mundaneum "Mundaneum")
was imagined by [Paul
Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
with support of [Henri La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine")
at the end of the 19th century. At that time colonialism was at its
height, bringing a steady stream of income to occidental countries which
created a sense of security that made everything seem possible.
According to some of the most forward thinking persons of the time it
felt as if the intellectual and material benefits of rational thinking
could universally become the source of all goods. Far from any actual
move towards independence, the first tensions between
colonial/commercial powers were starting to manifest themselves. Already
some conflicts erupted, mainly to defend commercial interests such as
during the Fashoda crisis and the Boers war. The sense of strength
brought to colonial powers by the large influx of money was however
quickly tempered by World War I that was about to shake up modern
European society.

In this context [Henri La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine"),
energised by [Paul
Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")'s
encompassing view of classification systems and standards, strongly
associates the Mundaneum project with an ideal of world peace. This was
a conscious process of thought; they believed that this universal
archive of all knowledge represented a resource for the promotion of
education towards the development of better social relations. While
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
and [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine")
were not directly concerned with economical and colonial issues, their
ideals were nevertheless fed by the wealth of the epoch. The Mundaneum
archives were furthermore established with a clear intention, and a
major effort was done to include documents that referred to often
neglected topics or that could be considered as alternative thinking,
such as the well known archives of the feminist movement in Belgium and
information on anarchism and pacifism. In line with the general dynamism
caused by a growing wealth in Europe at the turn of the century, the
Mundaneum project seemed to be always growing in size and ambition. It
also clearly appears that the project was embedded in the international
and 'politico-economical' context of its time and in many aspects linked
to a larger movement that engaged civil society towards a
proto-structure of networked society. Via the development of
infrastructures for communication and international regulations, [Henri
La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine")
was part of several international initiatives. For example he launched
the 'Bureau International de la paix' as early as 1907 and a few years
after, in 1910, the 'International Union of Associations'. Overall his
interventions helped to root the process of archive collection in a
larger network of associations and regulatory structures.
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")'s
view of archives and organisation extended to all domains and [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_La_Fontaine "Henri La Fontaine")
asserted that general peace could be achieved through social development
by the means of education and access to knowledge. Their common view was
nurtured by an acute perception of their epoch, they observed and often
contributed to most of the major experiments that were triggered by the
ongoing reflection about the new organisation modalities of society.

The ever ambitious process of building the Mundaneum archives took place
in the context of a growing internationalisation of society, while at
the same time the social gap was increasing due to the expansion of
industrial society. Furthermore, the internationalisation of finances
and relations did not only concern industrial society, it also acted as
a motivation to structure social and political networks, among others
via political negotiations and the institution of civil society
organisations. Several broad structures dedicated to the regulation of
international relations were created simultaneous with the worldwide
spreading of an industrial economy. They aimed to formulate a world view
that would be based on international agreements and communication
systems regulated by governments and structured via civil society
organisations, rather than leaving everything to individual and
commercial initiatives.
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
and [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
spent a large part of their lives attempting to formulate a mondial
society. While [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
clearly supported international networks of civil society organisations,
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet"),
according to Vincent Capdepuy^[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)^, was the first
person to use the French term
[Mondialisation](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mondialisation "Mondialisation")
far ahead of his time, advocating what would become after World War II
an important movement that claimed to work for the development of an
international regulatory system.
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
also mentioned that this
'[Mondial](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Mondialisation "Mondialisation")'
process was directly related to the necessity of a new repartition and
the regulation of natural goods (think: diamonds and gold ...), he
writes:

> « Un droit nouveau doit remplacer alors le droit ancien pour préparer
> et organiser une nouvelle répartition. La “question sociale” a posé le
> problème à l’intérieur ; “la question internationale” pose le même
> problème à l’extérieur entre peuples. Notre époque a poursuivi une
> certaine socialisation de biens. \[…\] Il s’agit, si l’on peut
> employer cette expression, de socialiser le droit international, comme
> on a socialisé le droit privé, et de prendre à l’égard des richesses
> naturelles des mesures de “mondialisation”. »^[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)^.

The approaches of [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
and
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
already bear certain differences, as one (Lafontaine) emphasises an
organisation based on local civil society structures which implies
direct participation, while the other (Otlet) focuses more on management
and global organisation managed by a regulatory framework. It is
interesting to look at these early concepts that were participating to a
larger movement called 'the first mondialisation', and understand how
they differ from current forms of globalisation which equally involve
private and public instances and various infrastructures.

The project of
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
and
[Lafontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
took place in an era of international agreements over communication
networks. It is known and often a subject of fascination that the global
project of the Mundaneum also involved the conception of a technical
infrastructure and communication systems that were conceived in between
the two World Wars. Some of them such as the
[Mondothèque](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/La_Mondoth%C3%A8que "La Mondothèque")
were imagined as prospective possibilities, but others were already
implemented at the time and formed the basis of an international
communication network, consisting of postal services and telegraph
networks. It is less acknowledged that the epoch was also a time of
international agreements between countries, structuring and normalising
international life; some of these structures still form the basis of our
actual global economy, but they are all challenged by private capitalist
structures. The existing postal and telegraph networks covered the
entire planet, and agreements that regulated the price of the stamp
allowing for postal services to be used internationally, were recent.
They certainly were the first ones during where international agreements
regulated commercial interests to the benefit of individual
communication. [Henri
Lafontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
directly participated in these processes by asking for the postal
franchise to be waived for the transport of documents between
international libraries, to the benefit of among others the Mundaneum.
[Lafontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
was also an important promoter of larger international movements that
involved civil society organisations; he was the main responsible for
the 'Union internationale des associations', that acted as a network of
information-sharing, setting up modalities for exchange to the general
benefit of civil society. Furthermore, concerns were raised to rethink
social organisation that was harmed by industrial economy and this issue
was addressed in Brussels by the brand new discipline of sociology. The
'Ecole de Bruxelles'^[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)^ in which
[Otlet](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Paul_Otlet "Paul Otlet")
and [La
Fontaine](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Henri_Lafontaine "Henri Lafontaine")
both took part was already very early on trying to formulate a legal
discourse that could help address social inequalities, and eventually
come up with regulations that could help 're-engineer' social
organisation.

The Mundaneum project differentiates itself from contemporary
enterprises such as
[Google](http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/LA_M%C3%89GA-ENTREPRISE "LA MÉGA-ENTREPRISE"),
not only by its intentions, but also by its organisational context as it
clearly inscribed itself in an international regulatory framework that
was dedicated to the promotion of local civil society. How can we
understand the similarities and differences between the development of
the Mundaneum project and the current knowledge economy? The timeline
below attempts to re-situate the different events related to the rise
and fall of the Mundaneum in order to help situate the differences
between past and contemporary processes.
