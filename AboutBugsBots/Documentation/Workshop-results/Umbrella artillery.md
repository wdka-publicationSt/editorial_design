#Umbrella artillery#

Made during the *Domestic Drone Defense* workshop by Maaike De Laat.

Martha Stewart is drawn on the umbrella canvas to mess with the face recognition of the drone. 
Has a built in wifi jammer with a usb rechargeable power bank to interfere with the wireless connection of the drone and will make it drop down.
